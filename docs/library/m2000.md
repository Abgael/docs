# Philips - P2000T (M2000)

![](../image/core/m2000/machine.png)

## Background

The P2000T was Philips' first home computer, before they later switched to manufacturing MSX computers. The P2000T was a Z80-powered machine which launched in 1980 and was built like a tank. It featured an integrated keyboard, power supply, two cartridge slots and a very innovative and fast Mini-Cassette system (MDCR), which was fully automated and used mini tapes that could hold up to 42 kilobytes of data.

The P2000T was reasonably popular among hobbyists and kids in elementary schools in The Netherlands, as Philips promoted the machine strongly in the science and education sectors. Because of the relatively high introductory price and the fact that its SAA5050 video chip only supported teletext display mode, the P2000T never became the success that Philips hoped for.

While the system's video and sound capabilities were rather limited, some developers still were able to create remarkably good games, like a Pac-Man clone named "Ghosthunt", a Phoenix clone named "Fraxxon", a Lady Bug clone named "Lazy Bug" and a Breakout clone named "Brick-Wall".

The P2000T (M2000) emulator core has been authored by:

- Dion Olsthoorn
- Marcel the Kogel (who wrote the original emulator back in 1997)

and is licensed under:

- [GPL3](https://github.com/p2000t/M2000/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Usage

Playing P2000T games using the M2000 core works best when the core is in **'Game Focus'** mode, which allows it to take precedence in inputs. The reason is that **every** P2000T game relies on keyboard input and even the buttons of the RetroPad controller are internally emulating actual key presses.

The easiest way to automatically enable 'Game Focus' mode for the M2000 core is in **Settings > Input** where you set the option called **Auto Enable 'Game Focus' Mode** to `Detect`. Or correspondingly in retroarch.cfg set `input_auto_game_focus = "2"`. Be aware that the default hotkey for toggling the **Game Focus** mode is the **Scroll Lock** key, which might not be present on your keyboard. If that's the case, you'll need to remap it - for example to the **Tab** key.

## User 1 device types

The M2000 core supports the following device type(s) in the controls menu, bolded device types are the default for the specified user(s):

- **RetroKeyboard** - Keyboard. Keyboard inputs are always active.
- RetroPad - Joypad. The buttons are internally mapped to actual key presses (see information below).

## Joypad

| RetroPad Inputs                             | P2000T Key  | Keyboard Inputs  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_a.png)          | Space/fire  | Spacebar         |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_b.png)          | Space/fire  | Spacebar         |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_start.png)      | < START >   | Shift + 3        |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_select.png)     | < STOP >    | Shift + Period . |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_dpad_up.png)    | Up          | Up key           |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_dpad_down.png)  | Down        | Down key         |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_dpad_left.png)  | Left        | Left key         |
| ![](../image/retropad/retro_dpad_right.png) | Right       | Right key        |

### Support for games with alternative key mappings (e.g. Fraxxion)

Fraxxion is a game which uses the **Left** and **Up** keys to navigate the spaceship horizontally, which was done for easier control. To be able to use the D-pad for horizontal movement, you start Fraxxion, then open the menu and go to **Quick Menu > Controls > Port 1 Controls** and remap **D-Pad Right** to RetroPad **Up**. Now return to **Quick Menu > Controls**, click **Manage Remap Files** and select **Save Game Remap File** to save the remapping for Fraxxion only.
