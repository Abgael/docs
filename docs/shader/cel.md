# Cel

Shaders that produce a faux cel-shaded look. These shaders work best with early 3D content with very low-res textures.

## AdvCartoon

 * Ported from guest's old Pete's OGL2 plugin shader, the user can specify the thickness of the cartoon-style black border and how muted the colors become.

## MMJ Cel Shader

 * MMJ revisited their old Pete's OGL2 plugin shader to bring it up to date and get it working with RetroArch, resulting in this shader, which is available in single- and multi-pass flavors. It works best with hardware-rendered cores running in >= 4x internal resolution scale.
