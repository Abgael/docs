## Prerequisites

RetroArch requires PRO CFW to function. The easiest (and safest) way to get this is to install [Infinity](https://github.com/DaveeFTW/Infinity) on your PSP.

## Downloading, Installing and Updating

### Downloading

You can download a bundle with **Stable** version of RetroArch, all the supported cores and all the assets by clicking [here](http://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/{{ unit.stable }}/playstation/psp/RetroArch.7z). You can download **Nightly** version of RetroArch by clicking [here](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/playstation/psp/RetroArch.7z).

!!! info
	Nightly files will give you the latest developments. This is sometimes dangerous and sometimes innovative. We will use the Stable version and recommend it.

### Installing

Installation is also very simple. With the Memory Stick inserted into the console, plug in a Mini-USB cable to the console. Connect the other end to a computer. On the console, go to the XMB --> Settings --> USB Mode. Go to the PSP/GAME directory of the Memory Stick on your computer and create a new folder there called RetroArch. Place the contents of the archive you downloaded in the previous step into this RetroArch folder. Wait for the progress bar on the PSP's display to disappear, then unplug the Mini USB cable. Press the circle button to exit to the XMB if the console didn't already send you there.

### Updating

Download the latest version and unzip it into 'PSP/GAME/RetroArch'. Accept when prompted to overwrite.
