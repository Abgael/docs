==You currently need to have a custom firmware called PRO-C to run RetroArch on your PlayStation Portable. Hardware or software changes on your device may damage your device. PRO-C must be running before running RetroArch, if you run RetroArch before running PRO-C, the device will say the executable is corrupted..==

## Prerequisites

The following things are required before starting

- A PSP (duh)
- Pro CFW(latest version)[^1]

## Downloading, Installing and Updating

### Downloading

You can download a bundle with the **Stable** version of RetroArch, all the supported cores and all the assets by clicking [here](http://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/{{ unit.stable }}/playstation/psp/RetroArch.7z). You can download the **Nightly** version of RetroArch with all the same extras by clicking [here](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/playstation/psp/RetroArch.7z).

!!! info
	Nightly builds will give you the latest development changes. This is sometimes unstable! We will use the Stable version for this guide.

### Installing

Installation is also very simple. Just create a `RetroArch` folder under `PSP/Game` directory on your Memory Stick and transfer the archive files to the `PSP/Game/RetroArch` folder, then go to `Memory Stickâ„¢` under **Game** press **X**, and then select RetroArch. Press **X** again to open.

### Updating

Download the latest version and extract it into 'PSP/Game/RetroArch' on the Memory Stick. Accept when prompted to overwrite.
