	Nightly files will give you the latest developments. This is sometimes dangerous and sometimes innovative. We will use the Stable version and recommend it.

You can download a bundle with **Stable** version of RetroArch, all the supported cores and all the assets by clicking [here](http://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.9.2/playstation/ps2/RetroArch.7z). You can download **Nightly** version of RetroArch by clicking [here](http://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/playstation/ps2/RetroArch_elf.7z).

### Installing

Installation is also very simple. Just create `RetroArch` folder where put all the cores (.elf). Copy this folder into a USB stick. Finally, use your favorite file explorer (usually `UlaunchELF`) to navigate to `mass0:\`, then enter in `RetroArch` folder and launch the core you wish.
